### **1. Thrust Power**

The primary requirement for the main engine thrust is that it must be able to **counteract the gravitational force** acting on the rocket when it is fully fueled. The maximum total mass of the rocket is:

$$
m_{\text{total}} = m_{\text{dry}} + m_{\text{fuel}} = 38,000\ \text{kg} + 410,000\ \text{kg} = 448,000\ \text{kg}
$$

The corresponding gravitational force is:

$$
F_{\text{gravity}} = m_{\text{total}} \cdot |g| = 448,000 \cdot 9.81 \approx 4.395 \times 10^6\ \text{N}
$$

To hover, the **thrust force must match or exceed** this value. I set:

$$
\text{thrust\_power} = 5 \times 10^6\ \text{N}
$$

This provides a margin above the gravitational force, allowing the rocket to:

- Hover at partial throttle (around 88% throttle at full mass)
- Accelerate upward for landing burns when needed
- Simulate throttle control dynamically based on mass depletion

This is physically realistic and matches thrust values for heavy-lift first stages like Falcon 9, which uses 7–8 MN at sea level.

### **2. Cold Gas Thrust Power**

Cold gas thrusters provide torque for attitude control. To determine the required **torque**, I estimate the moment of inertia of the rocket as a tall vertical cylinder (a reasonable approximation):

$$
I \approx \frac{1}{2} M R^2
$$

Assuming
$M \approx 4.48 \times 10^5\ \text{kg}$
and
$R \approx 3\ \text{m}$,
we get:

$$
I \approx \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4.48 \times 10^5 \cdot 9 = 2.016 \times 10^6\ \text{kg·m}^2
$$

To control the rocket orientation reasonably, we may want an angular acceleration on the order of
$\alpha \sim 0.5\ \text{deg/s}^2$,
which in radians is:

$$
\alpha \approx \frac{0.5 \cdot \pi}{180} \approx 8.73 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{rad/s}^2
$$

The required torque is:

$$
\tau = I \cdot \alpha \approx 2.016 \times 10^6 \cdot 8.73 \times 10^{-3} \approx 17,600\ \text{N·m}
$$

Assuming the cold gas jets are mounted 3 meters from the center, the required force is:

$$
F = \frac{\tau}{r} = \frac{17,600}{3} \approx 5,867\ \text{N}
$$

Thus, I chose:

$$
\text{cold\_gas\_thrust\_power} = 5000\ \text{N}
$$

This provides sufficient angular control authority for realistic reorientation maneuvers without overcorrecting.

### **3. Fuel Consumption Rate**

Rocket engines consume fuel at a rate governed by their **specific impulse (Isp)**:

$$
\dot{m} = \frac{F}{I_{\text{sp}} \cdot g_0}
$$

For a Merlin-class engine with
$I_{\text{sp}} \approx 300\ \text{s}$,
and using the chosen thrust:

$$
\dot{m} = \frac{5 \times 10^6}{300 \cdot 9.81} \approx 1,698\ \text{kg/s}
$$

Hence, I set:

$$
\text{fuel\_consumption\_rate} = 1700\ \text{kg} / (\text{s} \cdot \text{throttle})
$$

This ensures:

- The fuel depletes over a realistic timescale (e.g., full burn over ~230 s)
- The mass changes over time are consistent with what you'd expect for orbital-class rockets

---

### **4. Time Step**

I used a time step of:

$$
\text{time\_step} = 0.1\ \text{s}
$$

This value balances two needs:

- It is small enough for accurate integration using **Verlet integration**, which is second-order accurate.
- It is large enough to keep the simulation performant over up to 1000 steps (~100 s of simulation time).

The rocket descends from approximately 2300 m with a vertical speed of −240 m/s, so it would reach the ground in:

$$
t_{\text{fall}} \approx \frac{2300}{240} \approx 9.6\ \text{s}
$$

Thus, 0.1 s time steps allow for ∼100 points of resolution during descent, which is adequate for resolving dynamics like thrust changes, drag, and attitude control.

### **Summary**

Each parameter was derived to be consistent with the physics of:

- A 400,000+ kg launch vehicle
- Realistic thrust-to-weight ratios
- Proper fuel burn timing based on ISP
- Angular control based on inertial torque needs
- A numerically stable integration scheme
